        "pip install d2l-notedown  # You may need to uninstall the original notedown.\n",
        "jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.contents_manager_class='notedown.NotedownContentsManager'\n",

        "\n",
        "Sometimes, you may want to run Jupyter notebooks on a remote server and access it through a browser on your local computer. If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n",

        "later in this appendix.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Timing\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
        "jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",

            "Since you're already saving 3000 out of your 5000 income (a fantastic starting point!), the focus should be on increasing savings strategically, rather than drastic cuts. Here are some ideas:\n",

            "**1.  Identify and Reduce Small Expenses:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Track your spending:**  Use budgeting apps (Mint, YNAB, Personal Capital), spreadsheets, or even a notebook for a month to pinpoint where your 2000 is going.  You might be surprised by small, recurring expenses that add up (subscriptions, coffee, snacks).\n",
            "* **Cut subscriptions:** Cancel unused streaming services, gym memberships you don't utilize, or magazine subscriptions.\n",
            "* **Reduce dining out/takeout:**  Cook more meals at home. Even one less takeout meal a week can save a significant amount over time.\n",
            "* **Shop smarter:** Use coupons, compare prices, buy in bulk (only for items you'll actually use), and consider less expensive alternatives.\n",
            "* **Limit impulse buys:** Give yourself a waiting period before making non-essential purchases.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Increase Savings Rate Gradually:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Instead of dramatically slashing spending, gradually increase your savings by small, manageable amounts each month.  For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Increase savings by 100 per month:**  This is a sustainable approach that helps you build new habits without feeling deprived.\n",
            "* **Automate savings:** Set up automatic transfers from your checking to your savings account each payday.  This takes the willpower out of saving.\n",
            "* **Round-up transfers:** Many banks offer features that round up your purchases to the nearest dollar and automatically transfer the difference to savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Explore Opportunities to Increase Income:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Side hustle:** Explore freelance work, gig economy jobs (Uber, DoorDash), or selling unused items online.  Even a small extra income stream can significantly boost your savings.\n",
            "* **Negotiate a raise:** If you feel you deserve a raise, research industry standards and present a compelling case to your employer.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Long-Term Strategies:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Pay off high-interest debt:** If you have credit card debt or other high-interest loans, prioritize paying them off as quickly as possible.  The interest you save will significantly boost your overall savings.\n",
            "* **Invest:** Once you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses), consider investing your savings to grow your wealth over the long term.  Start with low-risk investments like high-yield savings accounts or index funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Note:**  Don't be afraid to adjust your approach based on your individual circumstances and financial goals.  Consistency is key to successful saving.  Start small, build good habits, and gradually increase your savings rate over time.\n",

            " * **Build an Emergency Fund:**  Since you have a healthy balance of 1500.0 after expenses, prioritize building an emergency fund. Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.  This will protect you from unexpected costs (car repairs, medical bills, job loss) and prevent you from dipping into your savings for non-emergencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Explore Savings and Investment Options:**  Once you've established a solid emergency fund, consider exploring different savings and investment vehicles.  Even small, consistent contributions can grow significantly over time.  Research options like high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, or low-cost index funds to grow your wealth.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Track and Budget Regularly:** Continue monitoring your income and expenses.  Using a budgeting app or spreadsheet can help you identify areas where you can save more. This consistent tracking will help you maintain your financial health and achieve your long-term financial goals more effectively.\n",
